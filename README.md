#Time-Series Modeling of Air Pollution using Satistical and Neural Network Approch

This project uses ConvLSTM and XGBoost to predict major air pollutants (CO, NO, NO₂, O₃, SO₂, PM2.5, PM10, NH₃), aiming to improve early warnings and support data-driven policies. A Bayesian optimizer is used to enhance model accuracy. Future work will explore models like AR, SARIMA, Holt-Winters, Prophet, Stacked LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and Autoencoder LSTM for improved forecasting.
